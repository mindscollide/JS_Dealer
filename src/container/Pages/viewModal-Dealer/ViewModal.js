                      Stock futures were mixed in early morning trading
                      Wednesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a

                      Futures on the blue-chip Dow rose 28 points. S&P 500
                      futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures edged 0.2% lower.

                      On Tuesday, while the Dow climbed 200 points to a new
                      high, the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite suffered a
                      sell-off, down 1.3%, amid a rapid rise in Treasury yields.
                      The closely-watched benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was
                      as high as 1.71% Tuesday, triggering selling in
                      growth-oriented technology stocks.

                      Megacap tech stocks underperformed the S&P 500 Tuesday as
                      “investors reconsidered the value of such long-duration
                      assets in the wake of higher rates,” Chris Hussey, a
                      managing director at Goldman Sachs, said in a note.
